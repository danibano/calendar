# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a work day scheduler so that users can add events into a daily planner. The planner will display the current day and time which is powered using DayJs. The hour time blocks change color depending if the current hour is past, present or future. Inside the time block you can add and saves your event to the local storage so that if you reload the page it still exists. If I were to go back and add something I would add a clear all/clear hour button so that the user can have a clear text area.
